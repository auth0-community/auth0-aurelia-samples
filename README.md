# Auth0 Aurelia Samples
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/community-driven-brightgreen.svg"/> <br>

These samples demonstrate how to add authentication to a Aurelia application with Auth0.

**Embedded Integration Samples**

These samples use Auth0's [hosted login page](https://auth0.com/docs/hosted-pages/login) which offers the fastest, most secure, and most feature-rich way to add authentication to your app.

For samples which demonstrate how to embed the Lock widget or a custom login form directly into your application, see the [embedded-login](https://github.com/auth0-community/auth0-aurelia-samples/tree/embedded-login) branch.

To view specific sample, navigate to root folder and go to directory that you're interested in.
